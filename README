namespace net

all the mainX.cpps are previous boost::asio API tests.
the current testing unit is in rudp_main.cpp.

class Peer; 
/* This may very well be renamed. 
   This class will be the real interface that application code uses.
   Currently it serves as a testing unit.   */

namespace net::detail

class Connection;
/* This class currently supports basic concept of a virtual connection over two UDP sockets.
   Implementation of the reliability system and the congestion control are in progress. */
   
These codes are mainly for my own library usage, if you are interested then help yourself. 
However, please proceed with caution. If you want to know more about it I suggest you
check out this website: http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/
It's the place from which most of my implementations orignated.
